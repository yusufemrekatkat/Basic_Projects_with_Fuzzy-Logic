# 🏷️ Project 02: Dynamic Pricing Intelligence
### *Algorithmic Decision Making in Volatile Markets*

This project documents the engineering of a **Fuzzy Logic Pricing Engine** that moves beyond simple elasticity models. Instead of relying solely on "Supply and Demand," this system integrates **Market Competition** and **Brand Psychology** to optimize margins in real-time.

## 🛠 The Evolution: From Commodity to Brand Power
We built the pricing engine in three distinct evolutionary stages, proving that adding "Human Factors" creates a more resilient strategy than pure math.

| Phase | Scenario | Inputs | Strategic Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **Supply Chain** | Demand, Inventory | Balancing **Scarcity Power** vs. Liquidation Risk. |
| **02** | **Market War** | + Competitor Gap | Surviving price wars without destroying margins. |
| **03** | **Brand Moat** | + Customer Loyalty | Quantifying **Brand Equity** to resist undercutting. |


## 🧠 Core Methodology
As a **Mathematical Engineer**, I designed the logic to replicate the intuition of a seasoned Market Strategist.

### 1. Relative Pricing Logic
Unlike standard models that look at absolute prices, this engine evaluates the **Competitor Gap (%)**. 
* *Insight:* If a competitor is $50\%$ cheaper, the model triggers a "Survival Mode" (Slash Prices). However, if the gap is small ($-5\%$), it holds the line.

### 2. The "Loyalty Shield" (4th Dimension)
In the final stage, we introduced **Loyalty** as a mathematical dampener.
* *The Apple Effect:* Even when the Competitor Gap is negative (Cheaper), high loyalty inputs prevent the price from dropping. The logic shifts from "Competition" to "Dominance."

## 📊 Visualizing the Invisible
To analyze a 4-Input system (Demand, Inventory, Competition, Loyalty), we use **Dimensionality Slicing**.

* **The Slice:** We fix *Inventory* at "Healthy" and *Loyalty* at "High (Cult)".
* **The View:** This generates a **3D Surface** showing how the brand ignores competitor pressure. Unlike a standard commodity curve that collapses when undercut, this surface remains stable—visually proving the financial value of the brand.

## 🎯 Strategic Impact
* **Margin Protection:** Prevents algorithmic panic. The system refuses to lower prices for loyal customers just because a competitor is discounting.
* **Inventory Velocity:** During "Overstock" events, the logic overrides Brand Pride and forces a clearance to free up cash flow.
* **Dynamic Equilibrium:** The model finds the perfect mathematical balance between **Profit Maximization** (during scarcity) and **Survival** (during price wars).
